<ul>
<li><em>Mobile Device Data.</em> We automatically collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer), operating system, version information and system configuration information, device and application identification numbers, browser type and version, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If you are using our application(s), we may also collect information about the phone network associated with your mobile device, your mobile device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, and information about the features of our application(s) you accessed.</li>
<li><em>Push Notifications.</em> We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the application(s). If you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
<p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>
<p><strong>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</em></p>
<p><strong>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.</strong> We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.</li>

<li><strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</strong> We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
<p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="https://app.termly.io/builder/websites/029f924f-d032-4f0d-9042-0746e9c915b0/documents/2276428/Final%20Details/Version%20Date#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</li>
<li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>
<li>Analyse how our services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
<li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
<li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="https://app.termly.io/builder/websites/029f924f-d032-4f0d-9042-0746e9c915b0/documents/2276428/Final%20Details/Version%20Date#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>
<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
<p><strong>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p><strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
<p><strong>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>
<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.

<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section '<a href="https://app.termly.io/builder/websites/029f924f-d032-4f0d-9042-0746e9c915b0/documents/2276428/Final%20Details/Version%20Date#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below or updating your preferences.</p>
<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
<p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
<p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.

<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#122;&#108;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#64;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#99;&#108;&#97;&#115;&#104;&#102;&#114;&#117;&#105;&#116;&#46;&#109;&#101;">&#122;&#108;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#64;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#99;&#108;&#97;&#115;&#104;&#102;&#114;&#117;&#105;&#116;&#46;&#109;&#101;</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<p><strong>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the 'Shine The Light' law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services.

<p>If you are using an authorised agent to exercise your right to opt out we may deny a request if the authorised agent does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be 'selling' of your personal information.</p>
<p>Zleed has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. Zleed will not sell personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users, and other consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Your rights with respect to your personal data</strong></p>
<p>Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete</p>
<p>You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.</p>
<p>Right to be informed — Request to know</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>
<li>the categories of personal information that we collect;</li>
<li>the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;</li>
<li>whether we sell your personal information to third parties;</li>
<li>the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;</li>
<li>the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and</li>
<li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.</p>
<p>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>
<p>Verification process</p>
<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
<p>Other privacy rights</p>
<ul>
<li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
<li>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.</li>
<li>You can designate an authorised agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorised agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</li>
<li>You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#122;&#108;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#64;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#99;&#108;&#97;&#115;&#104;&#102;&#114;&#117;&#105;&#116;&#46;&#109;&#101;">&#122;&#108;&#101;&#101;&#100;&#64;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#99;&#108;&#97;&#115;&#104;&#102;&#114;&#117;&#105;&#116;&#46;&#109;&#101;</a>, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.
